# GameBreaker by WeWokeUpLikeThis
GameBreaker is a web application intended to gently remind the user to take a break from sitting, gaming, studying, or simply using the web. GameBreaker pops up after an hour of extreme productivity and leads the user through a five minute series of stretching and body strength.

Our group is aware of the increased risk of extended sitting as dedicated students that heavily work on and with computers. Mayo Clinic has released research indicating that extended sitting increases a number of health concerns including obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and cancer. As well as internal health, personally, our group contains people with pre-existing injuries that require regular stretching and movement to minimize chronic pain.

The goal of GameBreaker is to non-invasively set intervals of time to stretch and move around allowing the user to go back to their work with increased productivity and health.

We plan on further customization of time intervals for working and breaks, as well as, implementation of more animal tutorials with stretching and body strength options.
